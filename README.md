# Course slides for CMSC250 and CMSC420

From 2016 through 2021 I was a lecturer in the CS department of UMD, College Park. I taught two courses: **CMSC250**, freshman / sophomore - level Discrete Mathematics, and **CMSC420**, junior / senior - level Advanced Data Structures (balanced trees, hashes, suffix trees / tries / arrays, Huffman, LZW, KD-Trees, Quadtrees, skiplist, and others).

This repo holds all the slides from the last offerings of those courses, Fall 2019 for CMSC420 and Spring 2021 for CMSC250. Especially for CMSC420, where I could not find a suitable textbook to cover everything the course needed to offer, those slides can be a big help to a student. CMSC250 was loosely based on Epp and Rosen textbooks.

There's a ton of probably unnecessary memes and visuals. I found them to be helpful and even liked some of them myself.

I have chosen to NOT share example homeworks, quizzes and exams. If you are an instructor, educational content creator, or any kind of educator, and you'd like to take a peek at those, e-mail me at jason.filippou@gmail.com and we can figure something out.

There's no strings attached, no license or whatever. I encourage you to verify the information shared on the slides before you base a lecture on them. Everybody makes mistakes.
